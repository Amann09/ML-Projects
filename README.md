## **Fundamental Machine Learning Projects**

### **Rock vs Mine Prediction:**

    A Logistic Regression Model which classify between Rock and Mine Underwater using sonar data.

### **Diabetes Prediction:**

    A machine learning model, which uses Support Vector Machine algorithm to predict that a person is Diabetic or Non Diabetic. Dataset used in the model is PIMA Diabetes Dataset.

### **Customer Segmentation:**

    A Machine Learning model, which uses K-Means Clustering Algorithm to visualize clustered customer data into plots and to get better insights about the data. So that it can help us to make better decisions for the businesses.

### **Movie Recommendation System:**

    A Content and Popularity-based Recommendation System that uses Cosine Similarity Algorithm to find similarities between user data to recommend or suggest new movies to the users.

### **Credit Card Fraud Dectection:**

    A Credit Card Fraud Detection System that uses Logistic Regression Algorithm to detect whether a transaction is a Legit transaction or a Fraudulent transaction on a highly imbalanced dataset.

### **Image Processing:**

    1. Explored different kinds of Image Processing Methods to convert an image to Numpy array and how to manipulate image sizes.
    2. Explored libraries used for Image Processing such as matplotlib.image, Pillow, and OpenCV.
